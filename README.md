# Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis---MySQL-Project

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates an analysis of bank loan data using MySQL. We explore key financial metrics such as total loan amounts, loan statuses, and payment details by joining two datasets (finance_1 and finance_2). The analysis is performed using SQL queries, which provide insights into loan distribution, borrower creditworthiness, and payment performance.

**Datasets**

finance_1: Contains core loan details like issue date, loan amount, loan status, and more.
finance_2: Contains additional financial data such as revolving balance, total payment, and last credit pull date.
These tables are related by the id column, which acts as the primary key for both datasets.

**Project Structure**

The project is divided into multiple SQL queries that cover a variety of analytical tasks on the dataset. Each query is structured to answer specific questions related to loan distribution, borrower behavior, and financial status.
